# Cars external API fetcher

Machine coding where we need to build an api for fetching details of cars and model of cars. You need to create an api which will return list of car with given color and model of 2015-2019 (can vary). You can only hit api using postman and JSON should be the result.

Use 3rd party API from https://api-ninjas.com/api/cars
